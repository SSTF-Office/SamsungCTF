# Exchange for BT

## Description
There are only two inputs for user: order type and amount of BT.

The order price is determined by order type so itself is not controlled by user.

However, the actual price may differ with the price which had been shown. Because there is a trading fee, and the final amount of KRW will be calculated by using `round` function. (The exchange should have used `ceil` and `floor` function for calculating KRW amunt to buy and sell respectively, which can avoid someone else's (potential) loss.)

One can realize that the exchange uses `round` function by obeserving different BT values with step of 0.0001.
