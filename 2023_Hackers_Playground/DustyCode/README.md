# Dusty-Code
It's a dusty code that hasn't been used for a long time.

## Summary
	1. Providing lots of repositories(# of repo = 327)
	2. Most of them except one repo is not used in service. Player can guess the service repo with lastest commit time. All unused repo's lastest commit time is 5+ years ago.
	3. By auditing source code, player can exploit command injection vulnerability.
	4. Hack for Fun and Profit!
	
## How to Deploy

```
./deploy/run.sh
```

## Description(Provided to CTF player)

A large amount of source code has been leaked! If we analyze these codes and find service vulnerabilities, I think we can attack the server... However, it is not immediately known what the repository corresponding to the code of this service is. Even it is not guaranteed that the source code is exact matched to deployed service!

## Flag
```
SCTF{F1ind1ng_n33d1e_1n_h4ys74ck_a8c312}
