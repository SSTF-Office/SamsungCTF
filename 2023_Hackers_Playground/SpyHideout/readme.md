## Description

There is some cipher (e.g. some modification of [VIC cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC_cipher) )
implemented in graphical esolang (like [AsciiDots](https://esolangs.org/wiki/AsciiDots) or [Box](https://github.com/p-ranav/box) ), printed out on a paper. Paper is partially damaged and cut into pieces by scissors, but in a such manner that reconstruction is possible in a reasonable time. Pieces are randomly placed on the table or floor (like a Jigsaw puzzle) among other random story related stuff (like books, newspapers, CDs, keyboards, etc.) making a mess. Some stuff might have an additional clues or hints, like newspaper published date etc.

Given photo of this mess, participants have to reconstruct the paper and encryption algorithm from esolang, and then decipher given ciphertext to reveal the flag.
