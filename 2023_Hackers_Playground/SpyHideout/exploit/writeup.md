<h2>Writeup</h2>

Box is a text-based visual programming language inspired by Unreal Engine blueprint function graphs. Ok, is just a blueprint, try to understand what coded on it.

`f0`  
convert number to their digits array  
`f1`  
this function substract every element of array by module 10  
`f2`  
 ordering the elements of an input from 1-10 (where '0' represents 10).  Alphabetical order is used. In the event of equal values, then the leftmost value is sequenced firs.  
`f4`  
 this function extend array by putting modular adding digits by order  
`f5`  
 replaces each digit in a number with one from a key sequence that represents its position in the 1-10 ordering  
`f6`  
 last two not equal digit  
`f7`  
 this function add each element from both array by module 10  
`f8`  
 ordering the elements of an input from 1-10 (where '0' represents 10).  numbers order is used. In the event of equal values, then the leftmost value is sequenced firs.   
`f9`  
replace elements to new array by column in order of first array  
`f10`  
replace elements to new array by triangle triangle regions where k-th region rested with the upper left corner on the line with the number of order.  
`f11`  
transform alphabet with puting input in start and encode symbols trough final matrix
`f12`  
this function is mor complex and use functions are listed above, after steps of sequencing and extending, function make transposition(f9) look like VIC algorithm  
`f13`  
this is main function and use all of above, function make key derivation and diagonal transposing matrix for find encrypt message
