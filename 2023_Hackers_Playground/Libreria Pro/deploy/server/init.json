Contrary to popular belief, they didn't explode to massive worldwide popularity simply by building a great product then crossing their fingers and hoping it would catch on. There was a studied, carefully implemented methodology behind these companies' extraordinary rise. That methodology is called Growth Hacking, and it's practitioners include not just today's hottest start-ups, but also companies like IBM, Walmart, and Microsoft as well as the millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, managers and executives who make up the community of GrowthHackers.com.\nThink of the Growth Hacking methodology as doing for market-share growth what Lean Start-Up did for product development, and Scrum did for productivity. It involves cross-functional teams and rapid-tempo testing and iteration that focuses customers attaining them, retaining them, engaging them, and motivating them to come back and buy more. \n\nAn accessible and practical toolkit that teams and companies in all industries can use to increase their customer base and market share, this book walks readers through the process of creating and executing their own custom-made growth hacking strategy.

Chained exploits are far more complex and far more difficult to defend. Few security or hacking books cover them well and most donrsquo;t cover them at all. Now therersquo;s a book that brings together start-to-finish information about todayrsquo;s most widespread chained exploitsboth how to perform them and how to prevent them. Chained Exploitsdemonstrates this advanced hacking attack technique through detailed examples that reflect real-world attack strategies, use todayrsquo;s most common attack tools, and focus on actual high-value targets, including credit card and healthcare data. Relentlessly thorough and realistic, this book covers the full spectrum of attack avenues, from wireless networks to physical access and social engineering. Writing for security, network, and other IT professionals, the authors take you through each attack, one step at a time, and then introduce todayrsquo;s most effective countermeasures- both technical and human.

One the one hand, hackers infect the computers of the world, entering where they are not invited, taking over not just individual workstations but whole networks. On the other, hackers write the software that fuels the Internet, from the most popular web programmes to software fundamental to the Internet's existence. Beginning from an analysis of these two main types of hackers, categorised as crackers and Free Software/Open Source respectively, Tim Jordan gives the reader insight into the varied identities of hackers, including: * Hacktivism; hackers and populist politics * Cyberwar; hackers and the nation-state * Digital Proletariat; hacking for the man * Viruses; virtual life on the Internet * Digital Commons; hacking without software * Cypherpunks; encryption and digital security * Nerds and Geeks; hacking cultures or hacking without the hack * Cybercrime; blackest of black hat hacking Hackers end debates over the meaning of technological determinism while recognising that at any one moment we are all always determined by technology. Hackers work constantly within determinations of their actions created by technologies as they also alter software to enable entirely new possibilities for and limits to action in the virtual world.
