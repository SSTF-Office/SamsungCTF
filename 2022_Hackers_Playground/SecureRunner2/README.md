### Solving strategy

A challenge RSA Modulus Falut Injection into RSA CRT.

The challenge implementation is almost the same as `SecureRunner`, but a mitigation about RSA Falut Injection is added.

Now we cannot corrupt p or q value.

To solve the challenge, we should corrupt the modulus, `n` with the same manner of the `SecureRunner` exploit.

Before corrupting `n`, we should generate normal signatures for 6 commands.

And generate corrupted signatures with modified `n`.

Now that we have 6 normal/abnormal signature pairs, factorizing `n` is possible by using Modulus Fault Attack based on LLL.
