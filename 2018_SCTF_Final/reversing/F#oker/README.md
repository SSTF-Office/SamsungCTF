## How to solve
1. Decompile a given binary with .NET decompiler such as dotpeek.
2. Carve a super increasing sequence and a secret constant.
3. Take itmes such that their total sum is the same with the secret constant.
4. Since the given sequence is a super-increasing sequence, solving knap-sack
problem is so easy(within O(n))
5. The bit index would be in the same position of that of the flag.
