## Comment

Reverse Engineering problem written in Haskell


## How to Solve.

Using hsdecomp to see decompiled source code

And read the source code :)


## Requirements

1. To make an encoded flag, change the name of binary to flag like `mv EasyHaskell SCTF{This_is_flag}` and run the
   binary
2. String printed to stdout is the encoded flag


## Compile Environment

`sudo apt install ghc6`
